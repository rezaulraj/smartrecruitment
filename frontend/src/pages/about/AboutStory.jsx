          At Smart Recruit, we believe in the power of opportunity to transform
          lives. We are a dedicated recruitment agency that builds bridges
          between skilled workers from Nepal, Bangladesh, and India and
          rewarding careers in Europe. Since our inception in 2020, we've been
          on a mission to empower workers by providing them with the training,
          support, and opportunities they need to succeed in high-demand
          industries like hospitality, logistics, and healthcare.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify font-poppins">
          What sets us apart is our deep commitment to every worker's journeyâ€”we
          don't just place workers; we nurture their dreams, celebrate their
          successes, and stand by them every step of the way. With a network of
          trusted European employers and a passion for making a difference,
          Smart Recruit is more than a recruitment agency; we're a partner in
          building brighter futures.
